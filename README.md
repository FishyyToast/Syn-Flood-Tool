# Syn-Flood-Tool
Tool for syn flooding.
Made with love by me.

Installing the requirements:
```
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

Not sure what else to add here, just download all the requirements and you're good to go.
(Also the UI doesn't work that great, most features are still being worked on like the progress bar, logs, settings (some do work), etc.)
